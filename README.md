# PokeViewNTR

Wild pokemon information display for Pokemon Sun and Moon

Hotkeys are defined in [helpers.h](source/helpers.h)

### Disclaimer

By using this plugin, you accept the possibility that
your save may be damaged, possibly irreversibly, by this tool. This tool does
not alter the game's memory, so that is rare, but it is nonetheless a possibility.

This has been tested with a New 3DS running USA Pokemon Moon v1.1. If using
a different version of the game, the tool may either work differently than expected
or not at all. This is because the offsets used may change between versions.

### Usage

* Start: Enable/Disable Overlay
* R: Next target
* L: Previous target

Despite Sun and Moon only having double battles, there are four valid targets.

### Targets

* 1: Primary target
* 2: Secondary target in a normal double battle
* 3-7: Reserved for SOS battles. They seem to archive the order ally pokemon arrive in, but I'm not 100% sure how they work.
